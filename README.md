boxes
=====

A test bed for a generic editor / pager thingy for the toybox project.

The toybox project is at http://www.landley.net/code/toybox/ and boxes
is covered by the same license that toybox is.  Basically that's a two
clause BSD license, but see the LICENSE file from toybox for details.

This is a work in progress, proof of concept, playground, packaged up as
one big toy, to be self contained until the mess is cleaned up.  This
"boxes" toy itself will go away, to be replaced by individual editor /
pager toys and library bits.  Nothing is set in stone, lots of mess
inside, there's bugs, but at least it shows the general direction my
mind is wandering in.  As a bonus, it actually works, you can edit
stuff.

Please don't actually include this in toybox.  Just look at it and sneer
/ giggle, depending on your nature.  Drop it into the toys directory to
try it out, it's just one big toy.

If you want to see how it can be used to build specific editors, start
at the end and work backwards.  Reading the lengthy comments at the
beginning would also be useful.

Toybox uses mecurial instead of git, but I keep all my stuff on github. 
Boxes will hopefully be incorporated into toybox in a highly altered
form some day in the future.  So this is just a temporary git repo for
my convenience.  If and when boxes migrates to toybox, this repo will be
retired.
